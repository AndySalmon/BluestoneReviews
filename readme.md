## About Guest Review API

This project was written for a practical assessment and is not suitable for use in any commercial application.

This repository will be made private again once it is no longer required for appraisal.

## To Dos

There are many aspects of this project that are not 100% complete as it is primarily an example for assessment.

- The social media publishers are simply placeholders sitting behind a facade that will be responsible for publishing. In a real it will most likely post a message to a message queue which would in turn callback this or another app to do the publishing.

## Database

A sample database can be created by visiting the api endpoint /migratedb.
